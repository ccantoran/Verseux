# Welcome to my Verseux Repo!
This project I created a website for a local Chicago restaurant named Veseux. This cafe was new to the scene and needed to establish their online presence!

Check out the live site:

# How It Was Made
Initially, my first design was rejected and a new layout had to be created for the client. Happy to accomodate! In the changes, we included to showcase the dishes 
served. The most elegant way to show this was to show the pictures in a grid layout and as an added bonus the grid also flips to show/describe the dish on the other 
side. This card flip was made for all screen sizes. The tech used in this project was HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

# Optimizations
Some optimizations that could be done would be to reduce and compress the image just a tad bit more. This would help the images load instanteously rather than having the user wait for the pictures to load. 

# Lessons learned

Oooh boy.. I learned alright! This was my very first client for COLLABS. I learned so much! In terms of web design it really polished my rusty CSS & HTML. This project was very humbling! I learned how to toggle my hamburger menu for mobile! But my biggest lesson was learning how to flip my pictures and have a description on the back! Oh boy did it take me a minute to learn. I went to tutorial-hell and back! And im happy to report that Iâ€™m ready for more!
